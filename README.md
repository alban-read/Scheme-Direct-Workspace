# Scheme-Windows-Workspace
This is a windows workspace for scheme (native win32 C++ version.)

## Reason

I like interactive environments; prefer a workspace type interface to a terminal interface; dislike text rushing off the screen; 
like to split results and output into a different pane than the script source.

Prefer tiled panes rather than overlapping windows; there are several standard view combinations that rearrange the panes.

I use versions of this to drive dozens of C libaries; Chez Scheme is very good at that.

## fun things

You can work through the online Scheme programming book; executing the examples as you go.

## Win32 version

This is the more old-fashioned conventional win32 version of a workspace for running scheme.

It uses the legacy web view for documentation and Scintilla for text.

## Requires Windows 10 64bit.
