#### A note for old timers who miss the 8bit days

***Some old timers miss the constraints of the old 8bit days***

In the past you might have been constrained by an 8Mhz processor and some limited graphics hardware; today you are constrained by the need to move massive images in sixteen million colours; the constraints are just different.

***Some old timers miss the interactivity and direct access of the old 8bit days***

Welcome back to a completely interactive environment.

While generally safe you can still crash the app; by making a single mistake in a performance critical path.

The language used here was invented in the 1970s.

***Programming is just so easy now; it has become boring***

Sure; then write a great game; an application, or even a small demo.

This is not meant as a criticism; just a reminder that computers can still be fun; enjoy them.
