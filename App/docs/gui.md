# Workspace - text; browser; and image panes

### <a name="the-gui">The workspace</a>

The app creates a tiled workspace; full of text panes.

This is an alternative way to work interactively compared to a terminal.

Assuming a default layout; generally you enter an expression in the top evaluator pane; execute the expression;  get the results of the response in lower pane; and any printouts in the transcript to the right.

The script, its results and its output are separated. 

These are all scrolling text views.

You can select any expression you want to run; and press **shift+return** to run it.

Or you can run the entire view; using **control+return**.

### <a name="browser-pane">The browser pane</a>

This is a browser view  in a pane it is the default Windows browser control; which is typically based on IE11; I believe.

This pane exists for application documentation (such as this document) as an HTML viewer.

Selecting some text and pressing **shift-return** in the browser pane also evaluates the selection; just as in the text pane.

This browser view is also quite programmable; I do not recommend doing that; there are better ways to drive a browser from scheme.

#### <a name="image-pane">The image pane</a>

This displays an image; created typically by the GDI+ based drawing functions.

This pane exists as way to interactively test scripts that draw 2D images.

There are a couple of examples in the scripts folder; if you copy one and drop it onto the evaluator view it will draw a graphic.

#### <a name="graphics-functions">Graphics functions</a>

Use the GDI++ library; which is a 2D software based; alpha blending graphics library; perhaps some day Microsoft will open source it; and someone can improve it. 

- Use Image Layout and an image view will be displayed; your graphics commands will be displayed there.
- You can drag and drop an example from the scripts folder onto the Evaluator view; such as drawtree.ss which will draw a tree shape when evaluated. 

The idea here is not really to draw ferns and trees; I use this to create graphs and charts.

#### <a name="text-panes">Text editor panes</a>

These are the main point of the app; these are modern minimal windows editors; with bracket matching; using the Scintilla text editing component with some custom logic. 

- Brackets are matched in scheme code as you move the cursor.

- Results are displayed in the results pane.

- values that are printed are displayed in the transcript.

- The Transcript view displays some timing information


##### Commands in the editor pane

Arrow keys move in the pane.

You clear a pane with <control><l> as you may expect.

In the example above if you <control><return> the whole pane will be evaluated.

In the example above if you select just the fib execution; you can <shift><return>  to execute just that function.

The main thing I miss is in the editor is a code formatting function; so I plan to add that one day.

This editor has the sort of retro commands you might expect from a 1990s windows application; rather than a 1970s vintage teletype. Lets not judge one other.

##### Zoomable

- The text view zooms in and out; use control and mouse wheel.
- The html view does the same.

#### Keys in the text panes

Behave I believe like a normal windows app.

**Arrow keys** move the cursor; most keys insert a character at the cursor.

**ctrl-d** duplicates the current line.

**pageup pagedown** move up and down the pane.

**home end** move to start and end of lines.

**shift-end** selects a line

**ctrl-home ctrl-end** move to start and end of text.

**ctrl-shift-home ctrl-shift-end** move to start or end of text; and select it.

**ctrl-arrow** will jump along the line.

**ctrl-shift-arrow** will jump along the line; selecting.

**tab** moves right 4 spaces.

**insert** switches between insert and overtype modes; cursor changes.

**delete**  deletes forward

**backspace** deletes back

**shift-return** evaluates the selection

**ctrl-return** evaluates the pane.

## <a name="the-escape-key">Escape key handlerÂ </a>

*Be mindful; that some code can run away; and never stop; which will require you to kill the app.*

If you run a script you may want to also interrupt it early.

- The Terminal responds to <ctrl>+<c> signals; so you can interrupt any running function.
- I would very much like to send that same interrupt to the engine when escape is pressed which would solve some problems below; if you know how to do that; please let me know.
- Meanwhile library and user code *should check for the escape key*.

You need to add a check for the escape key into any loops you write in your scripts.

For example this is an infinite loop; that will start to count up to infinity; not a good thing to tell a computer to do.

```scheme
; !!! do not run this. it never ends.
!(let loop ((i 1))
  (display (number->string i)) 
  (newline)
  (loop (+ 1 i)))
```

If you run this is in a terminal you could hit <control><c> and it would stop.

However this will run *in the app for ever*; since killing a running thread is a very bad thing to do; as it will often just lead to a subsequent crash. So the app chooses not to kill it.

For that reason we often need to add an escape key check to any functions that might repeat forever.

```scheme
(when (escape-pressed?) (raise "Escape Key!"))
```

So we have :-

```scheme
(let loop ((i 1))
  (when (escape-pressed?) (raise "Escape Key!"))
  (display (number->string i)) 
  (newline)
  (loop (+ 1 i)))
```

For the shell application only:-

The defined **dotimes** and **while** commands already check for escape; and a for loop is not infinite anyway. The trend with scheme to use recursion for all loops; does make this hazardous; remember to add this to your code if you want it to be interruptible.

```scheme
(when (escape-pressed?) (raise "Escape Key!"))
```
